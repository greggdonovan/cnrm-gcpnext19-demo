# Danger danger! Many of these deps cannot be upgraded past their current
# release, because the new eggs/wheels don't include the metadata.json file
# required for rules_python to calculate transitive dependencies.  That results
# in run-time failures as missing deps can't be loaded.  Update with caution
# until these are fixed:
# - https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/90
# - https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/121

# NB: Bazel does not load this file directly, but loads requirements.lock.txt
# with a fixed set of resolved transitive dependencies.  Use
# `dev-scripts/dependencies/generate.sh --python` to update that file after changing this
# file.
